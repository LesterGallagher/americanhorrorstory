This site is an inspiration style guide to some of the iconic American Horror Story characters. On this website you can search for different American Horror Story characters and their unique clothing styles.

**About me**

Here's some information about me because apparently that's what you need to do or something. Just kidding. My name is Eva, I'm 21 years old, I live in The Netherlands and I have a degree in Fashion Management & Design. Since I love clothing and I love the amazing (and sometimes disturbing) American Horror Story series I thought I could share my interests on a website, so here you go!
