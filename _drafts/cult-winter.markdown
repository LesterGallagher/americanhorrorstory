As we all know, season 7 of American Horror Story was all about Kai Anderson (who is portrayed by the amazing Evan Peters). In season 7 we follow the events around the presidential elections in 2016 and we follow the story of Kai becoming a cult leader in Michigan. We also get to meet Kai’s sister Winter, who is portrayed by Billie Lourd. Winter is a young woman worries about the outcome of Donald Trump’s election tot he US Presidency. Winter is a young woman worried about the outcome of Donald Trump's election to the US Presidency. She is morbidly fascinated by violence and gore and is terrified by her brother Kai, the person that she fears most in the world.

Winter is a 20-year old girl, with long silver hair, a porcelain doll face, and a modern gothic attire, consisting of black dresses with white collars, and Victorian-ish accessories. She is mostly seen in white blouses with ruffles or other details. She has different hairstyles throughout the season, sometimes she wears her hair in a high bun, a half of high ponytail or pigtails.

As I mentioned before, Winter wears a lot of white collars, she wears these with dresses or black tops.

The only real accessories we see Winter wear are big necklaces with old Victorian details and as for the colors, she mainly wears black and white, if she’s wearing color she is probably wearing dark red or dark blue. And as you can see Winter only wears long sleeves and she is almost always wearing clothing with a high neck/turtleneck.
