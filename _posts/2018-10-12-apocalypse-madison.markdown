**Warning: spoilers**
The witches are back! Who would’ve thought the witches from season 3 would make a comeback in season 8 of American Horror Story (named: Apocalypse). About a month ago Emma Roberts blessed us with an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnB53j2lMW4/?hl=en&taken-by=emmaroberts) post where we see her standing in her Madison Montgomery clothes which include big sunglasses and high boots.

At end of episode 3 of this season, Cordelia, Madison and Myrtle arrive at the underground bunker where we see them bring Mallory, Coco and Dinah back from the dead. The episode ends in Madison telling Mallory (who is portrayed by Billie Lourd) her famous “I bet you thought you’d seen the last of me” line. In episode 4 we go back in time before the apocalypse and we see that Michael Langdon (portrayed by Cody Fern) on a mission to bring back Madison and Queenie, another witch from season three. Madison was unfortunately stuck in Hell after dying at the end of season 3 while Queenie was stuck in Hotel Cortez, where she was playing cards with James March (portrayed by Evan Peter, of course) which was another great crossover from season 5: (“Hotel”). In the last scenes of episode 4 we see Michael, Queenie and Madison arriving at the underground bunker with great surprise by Cordelia.  In this scene Madison is wearing an amazing long black dress with lace detail sleeves that has a cut-out at the front. She wear this with black high heels and a black hat with sunglasses.
