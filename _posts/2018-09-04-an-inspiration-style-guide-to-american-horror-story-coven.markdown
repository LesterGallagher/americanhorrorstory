****Zoe Benson****

Zoe Benson is a character of American Horror Story’s third season (“Coven”), she is played by Taissa Farmiga. In the season Taissa plays the 17-year-old girl-next-door Zoe Benson who has her life turned upside-down in an instant when she discovers she is witch. She is being sent away to a school were young witches learn to control their gifts.
 
Zoe is a young girl with chest-long, straight, dark blonde hair. She is seen to wear it down with a center part most of the time. She is seen to wear very little makeup ad dresses in dark colors much of the time, often times pairing a hat with her ensemble.
 
**Style**
Zoe has a few things in het clothing style that catches your eye. She is wearing a lot of blouses and her dresses are mostly midi-length. Her style includes plain girl-next-door clothing, which could have something to do with the fact that she is a shy girl who doesn’t want to attract too much attention. Her dresses are mostly midi-lentgth combines with ankle boots/heels. She also combines her outfits with big black hats that give her an immediate witchy mistirous look.
 
 
**Casual Zoe**
As you can see, she has a relative simple casual style with simple sweaters. She does draws attention to her hair with a side braid or pigtails. Zoe can also been seen wearing multiple layers of clothing, her casual clothing mostly contains small details like her hair.

**Darker Zoe**
You can see Zoe wearing a lot of black and white blouses. She dresses more classic than most characters in the show. But she still gives it her own touch, like the dungarees for example. Something to keep in mind when you think about her style is the difference in mesh/transparent fabrics and black leather.

**Inspiration Looks**
In the first episode we see Zoe wearing this midi-length dress with little ankle boots. She combines this with her black hat. In this outfit you can see the mesh detail on the front, which Zoe wears a lot.


I had to include this iconic dress which is so cool looking. The waist belt, the sleeves, the hat just wow.
