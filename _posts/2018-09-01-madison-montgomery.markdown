**Madison Montgomery**

If you’ve seen the third season of Ryan Murphy’s American Horror Story (“Coven”) you’ll know there’s a thin line between loving and hating the character Madison Montgomery (played by Emma Roberts). We all have the love and hate relationship with Emma Roberts’ perfected bitchfaces and incredible hair-flips and that’s what makes this character so memorable.

Some background information of Madison, in case you kinda forgot season three of American Horror Story: Madison Montgomery is a 17-year-old out-of-control Hollywood starlet who is used to things going her way. But after becomding stranded at Miss Robichaux's Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies (aka witches, what the whole season is about) she learns that she needs more than star power to shine. Madison is a extremely powerful telekinetic witch and she is not afraid to tell you that.

**Style**

As we all know, Emma Roberts, with her thin figure, long legs and blonde hair is made for the role of being a mean girl. And that’s why you’ll see her character Madison wear revealing clothes that show of her figure. If there’s one thing you need to know about Madison’s style is that they accentuate her legs a lot with *high shoes or knee socks*. You’ll see a lot of outfits were she’s wearing knee socks or high shoes with skirts or shorts.
