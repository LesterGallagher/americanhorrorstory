**Madison Montgomery**

If you’ve seen the third season of Ryan Murphy’s American Horror Story (“Coven”) you’ll know there’s a thin line between loving and hating the character Madison Montgomery (played by Emma Roberts). We all have the love and hate relationship with Emma Roberts’ perfected bitchfaces and incredible hair-flips and that’s what makes this character so memorable.

Some background information of Madison, in case you kinda forgot season three of American Horror Story: Madison Montgomery is a 17-year-old out-of-control Hollywood starlet who is used to things going her way. But after becoming stranded at Miss Robichaux's Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies (aka witches, what the whole season is about) she learns that she needs more than star power to shine. Madison is an extremely powerful telekinetic witch and she is not afraid to tell you that.

**Style**
As we all know, Emma Roberts, with her thin figure, long legs and blonde hair, is made for the role of being a mean girl. And that’s why you’ll see her character Madison wear revealing clothes that show of her figure. If there’s one thing you need to know about Madison’s style is that they accentuate her legs a lot with high shoes or knee socks. You’ll see a lot of outfits were she’s wearing knee socks or high shoes with a skirt or shorts.

**Party Dress-Madison**
At the beginning of the show we see Madison wear tiny dresses with heels (preferably glitter heels) and a small purses. We can see that she has her party-dresses figured out and is ready to go. She keeps it simple with these dresses, she mostly combines them with small bracelets or earrings and she keeps her hair simple and straight.

**"Witchy"-Madison**
In the third season of American Horror Story we also see Madison wear a lot of black and other dark colors. The whole witch cast of this season also wears a lot of black. So when \[spoiler\] Madison dies and gets brought back to life one of the first things we see her wear is a black loose fitted dress with a chocker. And we can kind of sense that her Madison changed into a much darker character after being brought back to life. The accessories she wears with these long ‘witchy’ dresses are chockers because \[spoiler\] she got her throat cut which resulted in her death and that left a scar around her neck.

**“Casual” Madison**
The whole witch cast of season three can be seen wearing a lot of black/dark colors. Madison does too, but she combines the dark with the little glitter/glamour side of her, you can see her wearing black but with shiny gold details or accessories. This gives her clothes a real 'Madison' twist. Notice how she’s wearing knee socks/high shoes in a lot of these outfits and notice how she’s wearing a lot of hair accessories.

**Inspiration Looks**
If you want to recreate some of Madison Montgomery’s style then you can keep these things in mind:

* Try to keep the skirts short

* Keep the jewelry simple, don't over do it

* Try to show off your legs

* If you want to wear a coat, make sure it's a fur coat

* Hair accessories are important.

* And most importantly: put on some high shoes or socks
