Misty Day

Misty Day is a witch with extraordinary gifts who lived alone in a swamp before being brought into Miss Robichaux's Academy. She is a character in American Horror Story’s third season named Coven. She is portrayed by Lily Rabe. She possesses the natural born gift of resurgence: the ability to bring souls back from the dead.

**Style**

Misty Day’s clothing style will remain the same during the show. It’s very eccentric with a lot of accessories and details. If you can picture cordelia’s look for example, you’ll see that misty’s is exactly the opposite. Misty wears long drapey dresses with scarfs and fringes and a lot of rings and bracelets. She also is seen wearing waistbands corsets in some looks.
